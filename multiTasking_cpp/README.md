# freeRTOS_cpp Example

This example shows the implementation of cpp in esp-idf. It also implements multitasking using freeRTOS APIs to create tasks in cpp files.

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with Espressif SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming


### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)
